This section will explore the historical milestones and key developments that have shaped the field of cell therapy, highlighting the contributions of pioneering researchers and landmark studies that have paved the way for today's advancements. The development of cell therapy has been marked by several key historical milestones. The discovery of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) in the 1960s was a significant breakthrough, followed by the development of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens in the 1990s and personalized conditioning regimens in the 2000s (Chabannon2018HematopoieticSC pages 3-3). The first allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) was performed in 2004, and the infusion of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) was achieved in 2010 (Chabannon2018HematopoieticSC pages 3-3)."},{id:2,groupId:0,text:"Regulatory approvals also marked significant advancements in the field. The US FDA approved Carticel in 1997, the first MSC product in South Korea in 2011, and Hemacord in 2011. South Korea approved stem cell preparations like Cartistem and Cupistem in 2012. Prochymal was conditionally approved in 2012 in Canada and New Zealand to treat pediatric Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) (Vertès2016HistoryOM pages 4-5)."},{id:3,groupId:0,text:"The field has expanded to treat various diseases beyond cancer, including autoimmune diseases, infections, inflammation, degenerative diseases, and fibrosis. The optimization of genetically engineered immune cells is being pursued to reduce harmful cytokine release and prolong cell survival (He2019CellTP pages 4-4). The FDA approval of Kymriah, a cell-based gene therapy developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, for certain pediatric and young adult patients with refractory or relapse acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2017, was another significant milestone (He2019CellTP pages 1-1)."},{id:4,groupId:1,text:"At the heart of cell therapy lies a complex interplay of biological processes that enable the repair, replacement, or regeneration of damaged tissues and organs. This section delves into the fundamental biology that underpins cell therapy, including the role of stem cells, the mechanisms of tissue regeneration, and the importance of the immune system in mediating therapeutic effects. The underlying biology of cell therapy involves a deep understanding of basic biology, particularly how cells assemble to create tissue architecture and the molecular signals guiding this assembly. This knowledge is crucial for advancing cell-based therapies (Nerem2007CellbasedTF pages 1-2). Cells function is orchestrated by signals from their micro-environment, including soluble factors, physical forces, substrate/matrix, and contact with other cells. The key to regenerative medicine is delivering the right signals at the right time and place (Nerem2007CellbasedTF pages 2-3)."},{id:5,groupId:1,text:"Cell therapy also involves the selection of cell source, development of instructive biomaterials, and bioreactors for cell expansion. Cells can play a role in therapy by secreting molecules that alter the local environment, rather than directly replacing damaged cells. Critical issues in cell therapy include determining the source of cells (differentiated cells, stem cells, progenitor cells) and whether to use autologous or allogeneic cells for off-the-shelf availability (Nerem2007CellbasedTF pages 2-2)."},{id:6,groupId:1,text:"Exosomes, which are vehicles of intercellular signaling, play a crucial role in cell-to-cell signaling by transferring miRNA, which can regulate gene expression and prevent dedifferentiation of cells (Kourembanas2015ExosomesVO pages 7-7)."},{id:7,groupId:1,text:"In the context of heart failure, the underlying biology of cell therapy includes the potential of stem cells to improve cardiac function and regenerate viable myocardium (Sanganalmath2013CellTF pages 13-14)."},{id:8,groupId:1,text:"Various biological mechanisms underlying cell therapy are discussed, including immune reconstitution, cytolytic pathways, trafficking, regulatory T cells, effector memory T cells, adoptive cell therapy, vaccines, and newer approaches such as combining chemotherapy and biological therapy, ex-vivo activation and expansion of donor T cells, generation and infusion of tumor-specific T cells, infusion of selected T cell subsets, inactivation of alloreactive T cells, infusion of T-regulatory cells, generation of Th2 type T cells, manipulation of antigen presenting cells, and tumor-specific vaccines combined with cellular effectors (Brink2010RelapseAA pages 9-13)."},{id:9,groupId:2,text:"Cell therapy has emerged as a promising approach for treating a wide range of diseases, from cancer to genetic disorders. This section summarizes the latest advancements in cell therapy, focusing on the development of new therapeutic strategies and the diseases they target, including Friedreich's ataxia. Special mention will be made of the video on the left, showcasing the rotating protein structure of the human T cell receptor-CD3 complex, which exemplifies the molecular intricacies involved in cell therapy. The current progress on cell therapy for treating diseases, including Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), involves various approaches. One of the key strategies is the use of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are readily available, fast-growing, and have immune-privileges. MSCs can differentiate into a limited set of lineages including neurocytes and cardiomyocytes, offering prospects for treating neurologic and cardiac diseases. Research focuses on the cellular effects of MSCs, their secretion of trophic factors, and their ability to repair diseased phenotypes, restore cell functions, and promote favorable microenvironments for cell proliferation and protection (Isaacs2015ProspectsOG pages 5-6)."},{id:10,groupId:2,text:"In the context of FRDA, adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have shown the ability to transduce the FXN gene into the heart of a mouse model of FRDA, leading to prevention and reversal of FRDA-related cardiomyopathy.

Other studies have shown promising results in using cell therapy to treat FRDA, with TAT-frataxin fusion protein and TAT-MTScs-FXN treatment improving frataxin-deficient neurons and mouse models of the disease (Keita2022FriedreichAC pages 15-16)."},{id:11,groupId:2,text:"Furthermore, advancements in stem cell technology have opened new possibilities for treating diseases and disorders.
