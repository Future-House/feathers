## Accessibility

The `Label` component follows accessibility best practices and includes:

- Proper association with form controls via `htmlFor` attribute
- Click handling that focuses the associated control
- Screen reader support with semantic HTML
- Proper text styling that maintains readability
- Support for nested interactive elements
- ARIA compatibility for complex form structures

## Best Practices

- Always associate labels with their corresponding form controls
- Use clear, descriptive text that explains the purpose of the field
- Include required field indicators when necessary
- Maintain proper contrast ratios for text visibility
- Position labels consistently relative to their controls
- Consider label length and wrapping behavior
- Test with screen readers to ensure proper announcements
- Use `htmlFor` attribute to create explicit associations
- Avoid placeholder text as a replacement for proper labels
- Group related labels and controls logically in forms
