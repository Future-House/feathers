## Accessibility

The `FileUploadChat` component follows accessibility best practices:

- Provides proper ARIA labels for file input and drag-and-drop areas
- Supports keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Announces file upload status and errors to screen readers
- Maintains proper focus management throughout the upload process
- Uses semantic HTML elements for better screen reader compatibility
- Provides clear visual feedback for drag-and-drop states

## Best Practices

- Set appropriate `maxFiles` limits based on your use case and server capabilities
- Use specific `acceptedFileTypes` to guide users on what files they can upload
- Provide clear feedback when files are uploaded or removed
- Handle file upload errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Consider file size limits and validate them before upload
- Test drag-and-drop functionality across different browsers and devices
- Ensure the component works well on mobile devices where drag-and-drop may not be available
- Use the `onFilesUploaded` callback to handle file processing or validation
