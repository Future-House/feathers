## Component API

### Command

A fast, composable command palette built with cmdk. Features keyboard navigation, search filtering, and support for complex layouts with groups, separators, and shortcuts.

<PropsTable argTypes={CommandStories.default.argTypes} />

## Examples

### Command Dialog

A command palette opened in a modal dialog overlay.

<Canvas of={CommandStories.CommandDialogVariant} background="grid" />

### Searchable Command

A command palette with controlled search input and dynamic filtering.

<Canvas of={CommandStories.SearchableCommand} background="muted" />

### Grouped Commands

Commands organized into logical groups with separators and headings.

<Canvas of={CommandStories.GroupedCommands} background="card" />

### Loading State

<Canvas of={CommandStories.LoadingState} background="transparent" />

## Accessibility

The `Command` component follows the [WAI-ARIA Command design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) and includes:

- Full keyboard navigation with Arrow keys for item selection
- Enter key to execute commands
- Escape key to close dialogs
- Screen reader support with proper ARIA labels
- Live region updates for search results
- Focus management and trapping in dialog mode
- Proper grouping and labeling of command sections

## Best Practices

- Organize commands into logical groups with clear headings
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for frequently used commands
- Use icons to help users quickly identify commands
- Implement search functionality for large command sets
- Show loading states when commands are being fetched
- Use separators to visually group related commands
- Consider the order of commands (most used first, alphabetical, etc.)
- Provide clear feedback when commands are executed
